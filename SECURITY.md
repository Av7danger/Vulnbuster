## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities extremely seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any issues you find.

### 1. **IMPORTANT**: Do Not Create Public Issues
- Security vulnerabilities should be reported **privately** to prevent potential exploitation
- Public GitHub issues are not the appropriate place for security reports

### 2. How to Report
Please email our security team at security@vulnbuster.com with the subject line: `[SECURITY] Vulnerability Report`

Include the following details in your report:
- **Description**: Clear explanation of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential security impact and worst-case scenario
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed reproduction steps (code, config, etc.)
- **Environment**: OS, Python version, dependencies
- **Mitigation**: Any known workarounds or mitigations
- **Disclosure**: Your preference for public credit

### 3. Our Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**
   - Within 24 hours (weekdays)
   - You'll receive a tracking number for reference

2. **Investigation**
   - Initial assessment within 72 hours
   - We may request additional information

3. **Resolution**
   - Regular updates on our progress
   - Coordinated fix development
   - Security advisory preparation

4. **Disclosure**
   - Public announcement after patch release
   - Credit to reporters (unless requested otherwise)
