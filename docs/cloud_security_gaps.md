# Cloud Security Domain: Gaps and Enhancement Plan

## Current Limitations

### 1. Core Scanner Functionality
- **Missing Cloud Provider Integrations**
  - No actual implementation for AWS, Azure, or GCP SDKs
  - Placeholder methods need to be replaced with real API calls
  - No error handling for cloud provider API failures

### 2. Authentication and Authorization
- **Credential Management**
  - No secure credential handling
  - Missing support for different authentication methods
  - No credential validation

### 3. Security Checks
- **IAM Analysis**
  - No implementation of IAM policy parsing
  - Missing permission analysis
  - No risk scoring for IAM policies

- **Resource Scanning**
  - No implementation for S3/GCS/Blob storage scanning
  - Missing EC2/VM instance security checks
  - No network security group analysis

### 4. Configuration Analysis
- **Infrastructure as Code**
  - No parsing of Terraform/CloudFormation templates
  - Missing security policy validation
  - No drift detection between config and actual state

### 5. Reporting
- **Basic Reporting**
  - Limited report formats
  - No remediation guidance
  - Missing risk prioritization

## Proposed Enhancements

### 1. AWS Integration (Phase 1)
- [ ] Implement boto3 integration
- [ ] Add IAM policy analyzer
- [ ] Implement S3 bucket security checks
- [ ] Add EC2 instance security analysis
- [ ] Implement security group analyzer

### 2. Authentication and Credential Management
- [ ] Add secure credential storage
- [ ] Support multiple authentication methods
  - [ ] AWS: Profile, access keys, IAM roles
  - [ ] Azure: Service principal, managed identity
  - [ ] GCP: Service account, application default credentials
- [ ] Add credential validation

### 3. Security Checks Implementation

#### IAM Analysis
- [ ] Parse and analyze IAM policies
- [ ] Detect over-privileged roles
- [ ] Identify privilege escalation paths
- [ ] Check for unused credentials

#### Resource Scanning
- [ ] S3/GCS/Blob storage security
  - Public access checks
  - Encryption status
  - Access logging
- [ ] Compute instance security
  - Patch status
  - Security group rules
  - Instance metadata service (IMDS) configuration

### 4. Configuration Analysis
- [ ] Terraform template parsing
- [ ] CloudFormation template analysis
- [ ] Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template scanning
- [ ] GCP Deployment Manager templates

### 5. Enhanced Reporting
- [ ] HTML report generation
- [ ] JSON output for CI/CD integration
- [ ] Risk scoring and prioritization
- [ ] Remediation guidance
- [ ] Compliance mapping (CIS, NIST, etc.)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: AWS Foundation (2-3 weeks)
1. Set up AWS SDK integration
2. Implement basic IAM analysis
3. Add S3 security checks
4. Create basic reporting

### Phase 2: Enhanced AWS (2-3 weeks)
1. Add EC2 security analysis
2. Implement security group analysis
3. Add credential management
4. Enhance reporting

### Phase 3: Multi-cloud Support (4-6 weeks)
1. Add Azure integration
2. Add GCP integration
3. Implement cross-cloud analysis
4. Add compliance mapping

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Ongoing)
1. Add infrastructure as code scanning
2. Implement drift detection
3. Add automated remediation
4. Enhance AI/ML analysis

## Dependencies

### Required Python Packages
- boto3 (AWS)
- azure-identity, azure-mgmt-resource (Azure)
- google-cloud-resource-manager (GCP)
- pyyaml (for config parsing)
- python-jose (for JWT validation)

### Required Permissions
- AWS: SecurityAudit policy + service-specific read permissions
- Azure: Security Reader role + resource group read access
- GCP: Security Reviewer role + service-specific read permissions

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Mock AWS/Azure/GCP API responses
- Test individual analysis functions
- Validate report generation

### Integration Tests
- Test with real cloud accounts (sandboxed)
- Validate end-to-end scanning
- Test error conditions

### Performance Testing
- Measure scan time for large environments
- Optimize API call batching
- Implement caching where appropriate

## Success Metrics
- Number of security issues detected
- False positive rate
- Scan performance
- Resource utilization
- User adoption and feedback
