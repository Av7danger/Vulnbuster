# IoT Security Domain Documentation

## Overview
The IoT security domain is designed to analyze and test the security of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and firmware. Currently, it provides a basic scanner framework with stubbed functionality that needs to be implemented.

## Current State

### 1. Core Scanner
- **File**: `modes/iot/scanner.py`
- **Status**: Basic framework implemented
- **Features**:
  - Basic scan workflow
  - Placeholder methods for core functionality
  - Basic result collection

### 2. Scan Workflow

#### Current Implementation
1. **Metadata Extraction**
   - Basic target information
   - Scan timestamp

2. **Firmware Extraction** (Stubbed)
   - Placeholder for firmware extraction
   - Will support common firmware formats

3. **Configuration Analysis** (Stubbed)
   - Placeholder for config file scanning
   - Will analyze device configurations

4. **Embedded Web Analysis** (Stubbed)
   - Placeholder for web interface testing
   - Will test web-based management interfaces

5. **Static Analysis** (Stubbed)
   - Placeholder for code analysis
   - Will analyze firmware binaries and code
